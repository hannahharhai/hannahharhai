### Hi! My name is Hannah Harhai!

> [!abstract] WEEK 1

I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, and am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science from the School of Computing and Information. Currently, my interests in the field include Machine Learning, Full Stack Development, and Cloud Computing.

I use Github to work and collaborate on projects for school as well as for some personal side projects! I hope you find something here that interests you! :)
